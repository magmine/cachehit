## About
I'm a software engineer, passionate about building performant, scalable, maintainable and secure software

## Work experience

### From January 2021
* Software engineer, **SII GROUP** *Casablanca*, *Mororcco*
- Leading the development of a Node.js library that transforms EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) files to corresponding JSON files.
- The library is integrated with node-red
- The library can process hundreds of EDI files per second
- Currently working on a UI to visualize the processed EDI data  using Spring and ReactJS

### From February 2020 to August 2020
* Research assistant / C++ software engineering intern, **ORACLE LABS** *Casablanca*, *Morocco*

- I worked on a highly parallel and distributed graph processing system (PGX Distributed) written in modern C++.
- I collaborated on this project by adding new features, like:
    - Support for NULL properties in frames(The result of a graph query).
    - Filtering a graph (to create a sub-graph) based on a collection of IDs and the inverse operation.
- I've also benchmarked the system using TPC-H to compare the results with Oracle in-memory database, in a cluster of more than 100 powerful machines manipulated using SLURM.
- Wrote and enhanced Python and shell scripts to automate some of the benchmarking tasks. This resulted in an average 30% improvement on time spent on the benchmarks.

Technologies: C++, CMake, GDB, Java, Google Test, Python scripting, Shell scripting, SLURM, Linux, Jenkins, Multithreading.

## Education

From September 2015 to September 2020
* Software engineering **École nationale des sciences appliquées (ENSA)** *Khouribga*, *Morocco*

    A five years degree, where you get to learn many aspects of software
    engineering from theory to application.

From October 2018 to Mai 2019
* Software engineering **1337 future is loading (42 Network)** *Khouribga*, *Morocco*

    A programming school, based on projects and peer learning

## Awards & honors

November 2018
* **ACM MCPC** *(Moroccan Collegiate Programming Contest)*

    Bronze medalist (the third place from 63 best Moroccan university
    teams).
    The competition focuses on efficiently solving algorithmic problems
    using a programming language of choice in the shortest time possible.

* **ACM ACPC** *(Arab Collegiate Programming Contest)*

    61th position among the best 120 University teams from all the arab region.

* **MCC** *(Maghreb Coding Challeng)*

    Second position, amongst Moroccan teams and 5th among the teams of all other countries (about 100 teams from Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco).

## Projects


* **Language detector:**
    An app that detects the language of a text submitted by a user. Language words are stocked in a DAWG( Directed Acyclic Word Graph) to reduce memory footprint and have faster word search.
    Technologies : Python / Django / Django Rest in the backend and JavaScript / ReactJS in the frontend.

* **Graph processor:**

    It's the first draft for a graph processing engine. I started this project due
    to my interest in algorithms and data structures.
    The system is currently partially multi-threaded, supports two algorithms,
    and written in modern C++.

* **Typing corrector:**

    This is an academic project, where I wrote a program in C, that will detect
    duplicates and typing errors of a given text file, for that we used the
    Levenshtein Distance, with an approximate threshold.
    I was the first to finish the project among 120 students.

## Voluntary experience

From February 2019 to April 2019

* Software developer **ENSA Khouribga** *Khouribga*, *Morocco*

    I was in charge of developing and supervising a programming [competition](https://www.hackerrank.com/battlecode-01) related to one of our University events. Where
    I created algorithmic problems and their corresponding checkers, using
    C++ to score the 25 participant teams' submissions automatically.

# Mohammed Amine Maghous
---------------------------

## About
I'm a C++ software engineer, passionate about performance, computer architecture and building things from the ground up.

## Work experience

From February 2020 to August 2020
* Research assistant / C++ software engineering intern *ORACLE LABS* **Casablanca**, **Morocco**

    I worked on a highly parallel and distributed graph processing system,
    with a distributed team.
    
    I was responsible, first of all, for the extension of the graph filtering
    support. Secondly, I was responsible for adding the infrastructure
    needed to support NULL properties.
    
    Finally, I did system benchmarks with TPC-H and compared the results
    with BD ORACLE.
    
    Technologies: C++, CMake, GDB, Java, Google Test, Python scripting, Shell
    scripting, SLURM, Linux, Jenkins, Multithreading.

## Skills
- **Proficient in:** 

C++ | STL | C | Shell scripting | GIT | Linux

- **Experienced with:**

Make | CMake | GDB | OOP | JAVA | Python scripting | Google test |
Multithreading | Algorithms & Data structures | SLURM | Protobuff | SQL | SFML | UML.

- **Familiar with:**

Computer networking | Socket programming | Computer architecture | Distributed systems | Oracle DB | Jenkins | Docker.

## Education

From September 2015 to September 2020
* Software engineering *École nationale des sciences appliquées (ENSA)* **Khouribga**, **Morocco**

    A five years degree, where you get to learn many aspects of software
    engineering from theory to application.

## Awards & honors

November 2018
* **ACM MCPC** *(Moroccan Collegiate Programming Contest)*

    Bronze medalist (the third place from 63 best Moroccan university
    teams).
    The competition focuses on efficiently solving algorithmic problems
    using a programming language of choice in the shortest time possible.

## Projects

* **Graph processor:**

    It's the first draft for a graph processing engine. I started this project due
    to my interest in algorithms and data structures.
    The system is currently partially multi-threaded, supports two algorithms,
    and written in modern C++, you can find the code in github.

* **Libft (C library):**

    A static library where I reimplement many functions in libc (atoi(), strnstr
    ...etc.) using just some primitive system calls like free(), malloc(), read() and
    write().

* **Typing corrector:**

    This is an academic project, where I wrote a program in C, that will detect
    duplicates and typing errors of a given text file, for that we used the
    Levenshtein Distance, with an approximate threshold.
    My main achievement was being the first to finish the project among 120
    students.

## Languages

* **Arabic :** Native

* **Spanish:** Bilingual proficiency

* **French :** Professional working proficiency

* **English:** Professional working proficiency

* **Catalan:** Elemntary proficiency

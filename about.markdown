Hey folks!

I'm Mohammed Amine Maghous a recently graduated with a software engineering diploma, I like to learn and build new things especially in my favourite language C++. In this blog I will try to share my journey into software engineering while working with C++ and things I learn in the meantime like computer architecture and optimization techniques.
